# Deep Learning course from Udacity (ud730)

This repository contains the exercises from the Udacity Deep Learning Course, UD730, given by Vincent Vanhoucke in partnership with Google.

The exercises are done in Jupyter Notebooks. The base `.ipynb` files are given during the course and problemas are solved by the students.

The Notebooks are incremental, that is, the first Notebook downloads and preprocesses the notMNIST dataset, which is used in all follow-up exercises.
